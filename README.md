# Extra-Tech
Adds some futuristic items that use the magic item system.
### Currenty there is no way to acquire any of the things of the mod without debug mode, natural spawning coming soon.
## Items
- Repulsion Vest: Blasts nearby hostile creatures, dealing damage without harming the user. Uses batteries to operate
- Water Accumulator: generates a unit of water once every 8 hours, not enough to keep you hydrated on it's own, but can help to mantain a mobile, sustainable source of water.
